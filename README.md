## üó∫Ô∏è The project

This project will allow me to practice my knowledge in HTML and CSS.

Fresh Food is a technology company first, but with a major focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. Fresh Food want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use the app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and the AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. This will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.
